## Introduction

The _Task App_ is a standalone application designed to allow users to securely log in and perform various tasks. It leverages the _Task Service_ APIs to retrieve the necessary tasks and data, presenting a list of tasks that users need to complete. Each task is displayed with a dedicated view, enabling users to complete them efficiently. This setup allows tasks of a particular type to be generated by an application and subsequently completed within the Task App.

The task list is user-centric, time-ordered, and prioritized, ensuring that staff members can address tasks in a structured manner. These tasks typically arise from actions taken by end-users, such as filling out forms that then require staff attention. In general, the Task App can manage any task generated by the Task Service.

However, in practice, the Task App is currently configured to work only with the [Form Service](/adsp-monorepo/tutorials/form-service/introduction.html). Its primary feature is enabling GoA staff to review and process forms submitted through the Form Service. Other task types can be incorporated as needed, either by ADSP or other teams that request development access to the app, especially when the new types can be generalized and utilized by other ministries.

## Form Review and Disposition

When you first sign in to the app, e.g.

```
https://task.adsp-uat.alberta.ca/\<your tenant name\>
```

you are presented with a list of queues, each with a dashboard indicating the number of tasks that need to be completed and other queue metrics.

Clicking on the link to the queue will show the list of tasks in the queue. You can filter the list for those that are yours, pending, or active tasks.

Finally, clicking on the "Open" button will bring up the information to be reviewed, and allow the reviewer to determine the disposition of the form, if the role permits.
