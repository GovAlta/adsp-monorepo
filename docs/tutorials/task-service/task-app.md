## Introduction

The _Task Service_ makes it easy for applications to decouple work items through the use of queues, and the _Task App_ can be used to further still reduce implementation effort for an application by delegating those work items to it. In the abstract, the _Task App_ is a user-concentric, time-ordered, prioritized, _list of tasks_ that need to be undertaken by a staff member. These tasks are generally the result of an action taken by an end-user, such as the filling out of a form, that now needs to be followed up by someone in the government, such as a reviewer.

Currently, however, the _Task App_ has only been configured to work in conjunction with the [Form Service](/adsp-monorepo/tutorials/form-service/introduction.html). That is to say, the only feature available is for GoA staff to review and disposition forms submitted to the _Form Service_.
