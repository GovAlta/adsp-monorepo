## Repeated Items

There are two types of _repeated items_ in Jsonforms; the _list with details_, and the _array list_. The latter is a simple, sequential list of items ordered by time of entry. This is useful if the number of items is expected to be small or if each item contains a small number of elements. However, it may become unwieldy as the number grows larger, and this is where the _list with details_ comes into its own. It contains a simple means to navigate through the list, and displays one item at a time.
