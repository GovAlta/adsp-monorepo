## Form Submissions

Forms can be in one of several states - draft, locked, submitted, or archived - and it is the application's responsibility to manage them (if desired). The intended usage for these states is as follows:

- **Draft**: Some forms can be very complex and applicants may need days to complete them. While in draft mode data is being saved, but the application is not considered complete until submitted.

- **Submitted**: The applicant has completed the form to the best of their ability and wishes it to be reviewed. An assessor will determine the suitability of the application, but can request changes if any are needed. The form would go back into draft mode and the applicant can make the requested revisions. This back-and-forth revision process can go on as ling as needed. Each submission is saved separately, so there is a full history of application changes.

- **Archived**: This is useful for cases where the application is in the draft state, but the form was abandoned for whatever reason. It is up to the software application to determine when a draft form has become stale and can be archived.

- **Locked**: A draft application can become locked if there is some reason a reviewer needs to temporarily halt the application process. It is up to the software application to decide when it may be necessary to lock an application.
