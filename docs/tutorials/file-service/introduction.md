## Introduction

ADSP's _File Service_ is one that you can use for storing and managing file-based data. From uploading end-user documentation to storing content for presentation, the service gives you massively scalable, secure, storage for your data. Based on Microsoft's [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) and, coupled with our [File Type collections](/adsp-monorepo/tutorials/file-service/file-types.html), the file service gives you full control over who has access to your data, and who doesn't.

The service provides APIs that allow you to:

- Upload files to Azure Blob cloud Storage,
- Scan files for viruses and other malware,
- Grant file access permissions,
- Associate meta-data with a file, such as its unique ID, who uploaded it, whether or not it was infected, etc., and
- Search for files.

Azure Blob Storage itself is designed for

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser,
- Storing files for distributed access,
- Streaming video and audio,
- Writing to log files.

so when coupled with the _File Service_ applications can be sure their data both accessible and secure.
