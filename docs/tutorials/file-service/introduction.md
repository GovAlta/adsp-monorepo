## Introduction

ADSP's _File Service_ is one that you can use for storing and managing file-based data. From uploading end-user documentation to storing content for presentation, the service gives you massively scalable, secure, storage for your data. Based on Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage and, coupled with our [File Type collections](/adsp-monorepo/tutorials/file-service/file-types.md), the file service gives you full control over who has access to your data, and who doesn't.

The service provides APIs that allow you to:

- Upload files to Azure Blob cloud Storage
- Scan files for viruses and other malware
- Grant file access permissions
- Associate meta-data with a file, such as its unique ID, who uploaded it, whether or not it was infected, etc.
- Search for files
- Download files as streams
