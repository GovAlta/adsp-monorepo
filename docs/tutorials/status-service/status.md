## Application Status

Application status is the _operational status_ of your application that can be set manually through the Status Service page on the [Tenant Admin Webapp](https://adsp.alberta.ca) or automatically, by integrating the [status service APIs](https://api.adsp-uat.alberta.ca/autotest/?urls.primaryName=Status%20service) with your application. Operational status can take on one of four values:

- Operational: The application is up and running,
- Maintenance: The application is undergoing routine maintenance,
- Outage: The application is down,
- Reported Issues: An issue has been reported and is being looked into.
