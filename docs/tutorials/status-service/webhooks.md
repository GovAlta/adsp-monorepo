## Webhooks

<span style="color:red">--- Coming soon ---</span>

The _Status Service_ will soon be offering functionality that allows you to specify a webhook that would be called when certain events occur, such as

- a monitored application has not been responding for more than a certain number of minutes
- a monitored application has been back up for a certain number of minutes.

You could use these webhooks

- to enhance notifications,
- to start recovery procedures,
- to take other decisive actions,
- keep logs,
- etc.
