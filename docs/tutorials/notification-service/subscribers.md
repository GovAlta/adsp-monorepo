## Subscribers

Subscribers and subscriptions are created by your application through the [Notification Service APIs](https://api.adsp-uat.alberta.ca/autotest/?urls.primaryName=Notification%20service), or you can allow your users to manage their own subscriptions through the ADSP _Subscriber App_. Either way, your subscribers will be notified whenever your application triggers a _domain event_ that is associated with the _notification type_.
