  Scenario Outline: As a developer of a GoA digital service, I can consume the file service API to upload files from my service
    When a developer of a GoA digital service sends a file upload request with "<Request Endpoint>", "<Type Name>", "<File Name>" and "<Record Id>"
    Then "<Status Code>" is returned for the file upload request as well as a file urn with a successful upload

    Examples:
      | Request Endpoint | Type Name      | File Name        | Record Id             | Status Code |
      | /file/v1/files/  | autotest-type3 | autotest-new.txt | autotest-recordid-new | 200         |
  #     | /file/v1/files/  | autotest-type4 | autotest-new2.txt | autotest-recordid-new2 | 200         |
